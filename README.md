## Questionnaire

1. Who is your client?
    - Simon Cook from Encode Talent. He is a recruitment principle who runs his own company and focuses on candidate side more than client side.

2. What is your client’s need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

    - A major part of his work is dealing with candidates via phone calls, where he runs an extensive questionnaire to get as much information about them as possible. He spends 75% of his time on the phone and documents all his data manually in his notebook.
    - He has reached out to us to set up an online solution where he can get the candidates to fill out the questionnaire online and he can then view this once they submit it.

3. Describe the client’s current setup and data.
    - He is currently documenting all his data in his notebook and then manually entering the data into an excel spreadsheet.

4. Describe the project will you be conducting and how your App will address the client’s needs.

    - We will build an online solution. The app will feature a questionnaire that his candidates can fill out. He can view all their responses once they submit. He will have a database of all the candidates who submitted the questionnaire and will able to filter through them accodrding to his needs. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time used for phone calls and help him better keep track of all his clients.

5. Identify and describe the software (including databases) to be used in your App.

    - We will use Node.js as a runtime environment to build this app, and use React as our JavaScript library/framework to develop our frontend. We will also use Express framework for our backend, and connecting to MongoDB database by using Mongoose as our driver.

6. Identify and describe the network setup you will use in your development.

    - We will be using Internet to connect our servers to Now during development, and connecting to GitHub for group contribution. 
    - The app will have its frontend server using Netlify for production and connecting to its backend server at Now.
    - The backend server connects to Mongo database by using MongoDB Atlas as its platform.

7. Identify and describe the infrastructure (i.e. hardware) that your App will run on.

    - The app will be accessed by using web browser, which may be ran on different devices such as mobile phones, tablets or computers. 
    - The app will have its frontend and backend sitting on different servers, using services including Now, Netlify and cloud services such as AWS or Google cloud via Mongo Atlas.

8. Describe the architecture of your App.

    - flow and structures of the app

9. Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

    - The app consists of two major components: candidates and admininstrator. The candidate information will be collected, validated and stored into the database, and the administrator will be able to access the data for further management and manipulation.

10. Detail any third party services that your App will use.

    - The app will use Netlify and Now for its frontend and backend hosting, and use MongoDB Altas as the platform to manage MongoDB, which will be either hosted at AWS or Google Cloud. 
    - The app will use React and Express as its JavaScript library and framework, using Node.js as its runtime environment. 

11. Identify the database to be used in your app and provide a justification for your choice.

    - We will be using MongoDB as the main database for storing candidate information, because ......

12. Discuss the database relations to be implemented.

    - candidate collection

13. Provide your database schema design.

    - could be a simple drawing chart

14. Provide User stories for your App.

15. Provide Wireframes for your App.

    - **screenshot to lucidchart**

16. Describe the way Tasks are being allocated and tracked in your project.
    - Trello 

17. Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your App.

18. Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.
    - Git

19. Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.

    - Not going to be elaborate but mention some level of TDD and how we will test our deployments and user flow

20. Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security.
